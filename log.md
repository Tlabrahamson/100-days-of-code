### Day 11: May 18, 2020

### Day 20: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a client's WordPress website. I hope to make some time for some JavaScript hotness tonight.
            
**Thoughts:** I don't really enjoy working with WordPress. I understand why it is widely used but I have more fun with JavaScript.

### Day 21: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent time learning about some fancy JavaScript librarys. GSAP and ScrollMagic. They both help make smooth/slick animations.
            
**Thoughts:** I should use libraries more often. ;)
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 22: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Just about finished with my fancy-website project. Added more JavaScript animations and worked on responsive design.
            
**Thoughts:** I need to start practicing data structures and algorithms. It's the only thing holding me back.
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 23: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Taking a step away from all current projects except for client projects to work on data structures and algorithms. Today I built a stack.
            
**Thoughts:** This is going to be tough but necessary.
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 24: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued my studies on data structures. I can build a stack from memory. Started working on queues.
            
**Thoughts:** It may be difficult to retain all of this information. I will continue drilling it.
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 25: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Able to build a stack and a queue from scratch now. I'm practicing linked list for the rest of the day.
            
**Thoughts:** I hope to get a good grip on these data structures and begin to start thinking like a developer.
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 26: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning basic data structures. I understand how a linked list works but I can't quite work it out on my own yet. I'll keep cramming.
            
**Thoughts:** Honestly, I feel drained. There is so much going on outside of coding right now. It's hard to stay focused.
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 27: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Taking a little break from data structures to work on building a project. I started working with user authentication again and utilized auth0 for handling. I found it to be a bit more streamlined than Firebase and will no probably start from scratch with my social media project. It just seems like it may be worth it for handling the authentication. I still need to figure out what I want to do about a database though...Firebase?
            
**Thoughts:** Still feeling bummed. I want to build. I want to get hired. I want to feel good.

### Day 28: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Honestly, the more I look into the social media project, the more I don't want to work on it just yet. I am stepping away from that until my confidence grows and I find a better stack solution. Today I started building out a game using three.js. Sort of a 180 but I really want to do something that I will enjoy creating. This is for me. 
            
**Thoughts:** I've become super depressed. Not because of code. Every day I open my browser there is some new bit of news that hurts my soul. I wish nothing but happiness and equality for everyone.

### Day 29: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Began work on BIG FISH. I am hoping to be able to put together a little game. I have some cool stuff going so far but the logic may be difficult to implement. WE SHALL SEE!
            
**Thoughts:** Three.js is an amazing library. I have no clue how I hadn't heard of it before. 
            
**Link to work:** N/A




### Day 30: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I was able to display some 3D models to the screen for BIG FISH. I also have a little fish that follows the mouse cursor. I started working on the enemy fish.
            
**Thoughts:** Very impressed by three.js
