# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  I started building a web app that will help streamline writing logs for this challenge. I am also incorporating a countdown from an hour to ensure that an hour of coding gets done!

**Thoughts:** I have the day one of a challenge jitters. Yee-haw!
